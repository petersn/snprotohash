Experimental fast hash functions
================================

Build with:
```
./build.sh
```

snprotohash0
------------

Runs at ≈3.1 GiB/s on my laptop (i7-10750H @ 2.60GHz), with 130 cycles for a short message.
The `snprotohash0` program reads files very naively, and seems to get ≈1.8 GiB/s.
